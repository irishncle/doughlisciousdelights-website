                    <h2>The Sweet Journey of Dough-licious Delights</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>In a charming town where the sweet aroma of baked goods filled the air, five friends—Jericho, Irish, Crisha, Jhudiel, and Jeremiah—decided to turn their passion for pastries into a reality. It all started one sunny afternoon at their favorite café, where Jericho, a skilled baker, proposed the idea of opening a bakery. Inspired by his enthusiasm, Irish envisioned beautiful displays for their treats, while Crisha dreamed of creating unique flavors to surprise customers.

                    With Jhudiel capturing their journey through storytelling and Jeremiah managing the business side, the friends began experimenting in Jericho’s kitchen. After months of hard work, they opened Dough-licious Delights on a beautiful Saturday morning. Their quaint shop, adorned with pastel colors and the smell of freshly baked pastries, quickly became a local favorite.

                    <br> 
                    Each creation, from Jericho’s signature Berry Bliss Tart to Irish’s Floral Cupcakes, reflected their friendship and passion. Jhudiel’s stories brought their treats to life, while Jeremiah ensured everything ran smoothly.
